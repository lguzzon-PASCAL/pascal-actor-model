Warning !

NEVER share data across actors, this violates the principle of operation of the actor model.

As soon as you place some data into a message and sends it to the switchboard, the data doesnot belong to you anymore.

Exemple :


Var
	MyMessage : TMyMessage;
	
Begin
	Switchboard.Mailbox.Push(MyMessage); // Sent to other actor
	MyMessage.DoSomething; // <- this violates the actor model and is a source of race conditions !! 
	// As soon as you send data somewhere, it belongs now to the actor where it was sent to, not to the actor that sent it anymore...
End;

This can happen in quite strange ways, like when sharing a TStream or whatever.

Be sure to avoid this.
